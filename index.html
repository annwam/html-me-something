                      My first job was at a Pizza Hut.<br> 
                     I learned the how to make pizza dough, 
                     pan it,</br> dress it with toppings and make pizza.<br>
                    A skill i have utilized a lot in my adult life.</br>

                  <p class="inset">
                       I started off as a nurses assitant after a <br>few months of working at Pizza Hut.</br>
                       I worked weekends at an assisted living while going<br> to nursing school during the week for two years.</br> 
                       I graduated as a Lpn and started work at a rehab center.

                  <p>
                      I took a break from nursing school to join the United States Navy Reserve.<br>
                      Here I joined the Navy's Construction Batallion where I received training</br> as a 
                      Construction Electrician.

                  <h2>Personal Training</h2>
                  <p class="inset">
                      Working out is one of my hobbies. Friends started <br> for my help with fitness goals.</br> So I decided 
                      to take a class in Personal Training<br> so that I'd give people the right guidance. 
                      I am</br> a Nasm Certified Personal Trainer with passion for fitness.

                  <p>
                      I am always looking for ways to better myself. <br>So when I heard about LaunchCode,
                      I jumped to the opportunity</br> to learn programming that will open more doors for me 
                      in<br> my nursing career and whatever else I choose to take on.</br>
